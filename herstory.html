    Anti-racism has always been a fundamental principle of the movement to end violence against women and girls (VAWG) but has lacked meaningful action without a shared recognition of where we are, what we stand for and what we need to change. Black and minoritised women have no choice but to recognise racism because it is inherent in their lived experience, but for their white counterparts confronting racism has all too often been optional.
</p>

<p>
During 2020 we saw the powerful impact of the global call to action by Black Lives Matter (BLM) movements worldwide for racial justice following the murder of George Floyd. In the UK this led to wide-scale mobilisations and a reinvigorated anti-racism movement that has sharpened the focus on structural and everyday racism. The BLM movement has highlighted the persistence of white supremacy and led to a critical reckoning with the realities of racism within workplaces, communities and wider society.
</p>

<p>
Within the charity sector and wider social justice movement, Black and minoritised people have challenged how organisations can claim to stand for feminism, equality and justice whilst failing to tackle structural racism within their workplace. The VAWG sector is no exception.  
</p>

<p>
Systemic racism shapes how Black and minoritised women experience violence and abuse, and their access to safety, support and justice. Structural inequality is reproduced within our sector through inequitable funding, unequal power and partnerships, the appropriation of specialist services developed by Black and minoritised women, and continued failures to ensure that Black and minoritised women are treated equally within organisations and represented in leadership and governance structures.
</p>

<p>
None of these issues are new - they have been repeatedly raised by Black and minoritised women within the VAWG sector over many years. The Anti-Racism Working Group sought to centre anti-racism within the VAWG sector and provide a framework for meaningful action.
