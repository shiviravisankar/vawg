<p>We convened an anti-racism working group in the VAWG sector in May 2020 to open up space for dialogue, action and the development of anti-racist standards and practices for the sector to start the work to become explicitly anti-racist. The reinvigoration of the global Black Lives Matter movement that summer accelerated the urgency of the work to end racism in VAWG.</p>

<p>Imkaan, the UK-based, Black feminist organisation, were the host for the working group between 2021-23. Membership of the group has been on a voluntary basis, from a range of specialist VAWG organisations, and as such not all founder members currently remain part of the group.</p>

<li>Andrea Simon, End Violence Against Women Coalition</li>
<li>Estelle Du Boulay, Rights of Women</li>

<div class="disclaimer">
<p>*The group recognises that its membership has not been a full representation of all the organisations in the sector but emerged from those who stepped forward to lead on anti-racism work within the VAWG sector. The group is committed to inclusion and representation as critical for anti-racism work.*</p>
