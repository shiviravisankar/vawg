<p>The Anti-Racism Charter sets out a vision for anti-racist approach in the ending violence against women and girls (VAWG) sector.</p>
<p>It is needed because structural racism impacts how Black and minoritised women experience violence and abuse, and their access to safety, support and justice.</p>
<h1>Racism and inequality is also replicated within our sector too - and this stops us creating a world where all women and girls live free from violence and abuse</h1>
<p>The Charter seeks to tackle concerns that have been raised repeatedly over time by Black and minoritised women in our sector, over decades. It draws directly from the detailed work and recommendations of specialist 'by and for' Black and minoritised VAWG organisations and other anti-racist activists on what needs to change.</p>
<p>We hope it starts the process of the ongoing commitment, reflection and learning that is required for anti-racism, and provides an urgently needed mechanism for action and accountability within the VAWG sector.</p>

<p>Specialist services led &#39;by and for&#39; Black and minoritised women are a vital part of our sector and are uniquely able to reach Black and minoritised women, tackle the barriers they face to support, and deliver expert support with an understanding of the dynamics of gender, racism and discrimination that shape their experiences. The Charter calls on the VAWG sector to commit to support and stand in solidarity with &#39;by and for&#39; Black and minoritised women&#39;s services to end the systemic funding inequality they experience by,</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ensuring that white-led organisations consider their position of privilege and take action to create equal and level playing fields within funding and commissioning processes.
</li>
<li>
Ensuring &#39;by and for&#39; Black and minoritised women&#39;s services are meaningfully involved as co-creators and equal partners, including through equal partnerships and consortia and transparent processes to select lead partners within bids.
</li>
<li>Ensuring that the time and expertise of Black and minoritised women and their organisations is always compensated.</li>
<li>Demanding an end to funding and commissioning practices that perpetuate the exclusion and inequality of 'by and for' organisations.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="page2" class="page">
<p>Power imbalances within the VAWG sector persist, resulting in white-led organisations steering strategy, priorities and decision making in the sector, controlling the parameters of partnerships and excluding &#39;by and for&#39; organisations. It also results in ongoing micro-aggressions, bullying and poor analysis of state racism and the risks facing Black and minoritised women. The Charter calls on white-led organisations to demonstrate a genuine commitment to equality, ending power imbalances and meaningful collaboration with &#39;by and for&#39; Black and minoritised women&#39;s services, by: truth-telling and honesty about what it means to be a genuine ally within a partnership; respect and value for individual and organisational expertise; clear approaches to conflict management that recognise power imbalances; and equal sharing of resources within partnerships.</p>
</div>

<div id="page3" class="page">
<p>The autonomy, expertise, knowledge and specialism of &#39;by and for&#39; Black and minoritised women&#39;s organisations is not recognised, but appropriated when it serves to support the work of white-led organisations. This can include white-led organisations creating services and projects for specific communities, failing to recognise the unique value of &#39;by and for&#39; organisations, or subsuming &#39;by and for&#39; services altogether. The Charter calls on white-led organisations to end the appropriation of &#39;by and for&#39; Black and minoritised women&#39;s services by: supporting the need for their autonomy and structural independence; ensuring recognition, protection and equal representation and participation of &#39;by and for&#39; organisations; and developing a shared understanding of how cultural appropriation works within the VAWG sector and the steps required to end it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="page4" class="page">
<p>
At both national and local level, structural inequalities mean that &#39;by and for Black and minoritised women&#39;s organisations have less power, voice and visibility. Black and minoritised women being unrepresented within decision making spaces, from meetings to consultation processes, which means the experiences and inequalities facing their organisations and the survivors they support are not recognised. Representation is too often tokenistic and not meaningful. The Charter calls for &#39;by and for&#39; Black and minoritised women&#39;s organisations to be visible and represented, with white-led organisations taking an active role in disrupting power imbalances by: demanding that national and local decision making spaces include representation of &#39;by and for&#39; Black and minoritised organisations, with compensation for their time and expertise; learning from Black and minoritised women&#39;s organisations structural analysis of racism; and committing to understanding and identifying structural racism, and ending white silence in tackling racism and oppression.
</p>
</div>

<div id="page5" class="page">
<p>As in the wider charity sector, Black and minoritised women are under-represented in leadership positions in the sector. Black and minoritised women within white-led organisations have documented institutional racism within organisations, barriers to progression, a lack of safety, trust and respect, and failures to address racism within internal complaints and grievance procedures. Black and minoritised women within white-led organisations often carry the burden of anti-racism work within  their organisations without adjustment for the additional workload and recognition of the emotional toll. The Charter sets out a vision for leadership and governance in VAWG sector which challenges white supremacy, including through: senior leadership that is truly reflective of the survivors we exist to support, with Black and minoritised women supported into leadership roles; board level commitment and ownership of race equality; an ongoing process of learning and reflection of power, privilege and white supremacy within leadership teams; anti-racist recruitment and progression practices; robust procedures for reporting and redressing racism; and systemic approaches to ensure diversity, equity and racial inclusion at all levels.
</p>
</div>
<div id="page6" class="page">
<p>White feminist analysis remains predominant within our sector and results in policy positions, recommendations and partnerships which fail to tackle the multiple forms of oppression that Black and minoritised women experience. This has manifested in failure to recognise the racism and discrimination that Black and minoritised experience from the police, criminal justice system and other public bodies. The Charter calls for the VAWG sector to centre an intersectional approach and analysis within our policy, campaigning and public affairs work to challenge structural inequalities and racism, including through: going beyond looking at &#39;gender&#39; alone to centre multiple forms of oppression; always considering the specific needs of Black and minoritised women and the differential impacts of &#39;mainstream&#39; approaches; and taking a &#39;do no harm&#39; approach to policy development, aiming to end - and not compound - structural inequalities.</p>
</div>
<div id="page7" class="page">
<p>External communications within the VAWG sector do not effectively speak to all survivors, and are often not even accessible to all either. The current hostile media environment perpetuates narratives and stereotypes which subordinate Black and minoritised women, and this is not effectively challenged by VAWG sector organisations. The Charter calls for a VAWG sector which communicates in a truly inclusive way, including through: delivering consistently accessible communications and resources for survivors, tackling the barriers that women experiencing multiple forms of oppression face in accessing support; disrupting power imbalances within the sector&#39;s media and publicity work by sharing space, power and resources with &#39;by andn for&#39; Black and minoritised women&#39;s organisations; supporting Black and minoritised women with lived experience to speak out; and challenging media outlets on hostile reporting.
